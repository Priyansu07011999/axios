1. Why do we need headers ?
ans: -> Headers are like notes attached to a package (data) being sent over a network.
     -> They provide contextual information about the data, like its format, origin, intended recipient, and authentication details.
     -> This information helps servers understand and process the data correctly.


2. What is axios?
ans: -> Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests (network calls) from web applications.
     -> It simplifies sending and receiving data from websites and APIs, offering a cleaner and more readable syntax compared to native browser APIs.

3. What are the common problems faced when you make network calls and what should you do to solve it.
ans: i: common problems:
        -> Network Connectivity Issues
        -> DNS Resolution Errors
        -> Authentication Failures
        -> Server Errors
        -> Rate Limiting
        -> Timeouts
        -> Data Parsing Errors
        -> Security Vulnerabilities

    ii. solution:
        -> For network Connectivity issues check internet connection, restart router/modem, test different networks.
        -> For DNS Resolution Errors check DNS settings, flush DNS cache, use public DNS servers.
        -> For authentication Failures verify credentials, check for expired tokens, ensure correct authorization methods.
        -> For error in servers check server status, analyze error messages, contact server administrator if necessary.
        -> For rate Limiting implement retry logic with exponential backoff, reduce request frequency, contact API provider for increased limits.
        -> For timeout Increase timeout values, optimize network performance, reduce payload size.
        -> For data Parsing errors validate response data format, handle unexpected formats gracefully.
        -> For Security Vulnerabilities use HTTPS for secure connections, sanitize user input, avoid sending sensitive data in cleartext.
